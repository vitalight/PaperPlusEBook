# Paper Plus E-Book
A device combines ebook and real book. The user can read a papery book just like the normal book but there are no words printed on the book. Instead, we project the UI & content with our projector. And the reader can also take notes on the book with a pen which does not contains ink. We use 2 cameras to calculate the position the user put the pen-point on and draw it on our software and project it back on the paper.

This devices aims to offer convenience to the readers and provide them tradition reading and noting experience. They do not need multiple papery books any more. Also they can read pdf/txt files on a papery books.

* This system is too complicated to build up, and we only implement a primary version. So only a [video (click to download)](https://github.com/zrdumped/PaperPlusEBook/releases/download/v1.0/Paper+EBook.demo.mp4) and some photos can be shown.
